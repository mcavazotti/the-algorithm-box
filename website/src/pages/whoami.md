# Who am I?
My name is Matheus M Cavazotti. I'm a husband, a father and I happen to be a software engineer. I graduated in Computer Science at Universidade Federal do Paran√° (Brazil), I also received my Master's diploma from the same university.

My major field of interest is computer graphics and physics simulations. I don't consider myself one of the best in any of those fields, but I'm working my way towards it, and that't one of the reason for this website!
