# What is The Algorithm Box?

Before explaining what is this website about, I [(who am I?)](/whoami) will first explain why created this website.

I have the goal of working as a researcher in Computer Graphics, however, as I was finishing my Master's degree, I noticed how "out of shape" I was with my skills. I'd spent the last couple years working as a full-stack web developer, using mostly Typescript and Python, so it's no surprise I began to forget things such as memory management, complex algorithms and so on. Having said that, I've created this website with three goals in mind:

1. Challenge myself to remember and learn about algorithms and data structures
2. Improve my C++ programming skills, which are a bit rusty
3. Exercise my writing skills. Moreover, I've always looked up to those veterans who have those blogs rich with knowledge and I have the dream of being like that someday. Who knows **The Algorithm Box** will help other people someday?

## Now, answering the big question:

**The Algorithm Box** is a repository where I'll implement algorithms and data structure in C++. Besides the code, I'll write articles explaining the algorithms and their implementations, in a way similar to [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). I'll probably write about tooling (Makefile, CMake, Git, etc.) too.

## Disclaimers
:::warning
I'm not a veteran! 

I'm still learning, so there might be errors in my articles and bugs in my code. Please be patient!
