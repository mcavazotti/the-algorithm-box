A vector is a concept from linear algebra and we can say it forms the base of computer graphics. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)), "**vector** is a term that refers to quantities that cannot be expressed by a single number (a scalar), or to elements of some vector spaces". In very simple terms, vectors are lists of numbers with which we can perform operations.

The **dimensionality** of a vector is the number of values in it. While vectors can have any number of dimensions, in Computer Graphics we're mostly interested in 2D, 3D and 4D vectors.

## 2D Vector
Thinking about 2D space, we usually call its 2 axes $$x$$ and $$y$$. The $$x$$ axis points to the right, while the $$y$$ axis can point up or down, depending on the context: when talking about space, it usually points upwards, on the other hand, if we're talking about coordinates in an image on in a  screen, it points downwards.

Let's create a 2D vector!

First, let's start with the constructors: a default constructor to assing $$0$$ to $$x$$ and $$y$$ and another one to assing specific values.

Next, we can define simple arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We'll also define negation:

Now, let's write two more functions: the first calculates the vector length, or **magnitude**. If you imagine that the vector represent a position in space, its length would be its distance from the origin $$(0,0)$$
