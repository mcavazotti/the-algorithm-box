Matrices... here's a complex topic that I don't feel knowledgeable enough to explain in depth. I'll try to stick with the most fundamental concepts that are related to computer graphics.
:::

A matrix (*pl.* matrices) is a rectangular array of number which can have any shape (in fact, vectors are a particular type of matrix!). Matrices are such an important topic in Computer Science and Mathematics that there are complete university classes and research groups dedicated to study and teach them, however, here I'll only talk about a very limited set of matrices that are used all the time in computer graphics.

They are **2x2**, **3x3** and **4x4** matrices.

Just like with vectors, we can perform operations on matrices, but some of them are a bit different. We also have new operations for matrices. In this article I'll cover only the basic ones, in later articles I'll talk about other operations and common uses for matrices. Without further ado, let's get started!

## 2x2 Matrix
As you can guess from the name, it is a matrix with two numbers wide by two numbers high. $$\mathbb{R}$$
