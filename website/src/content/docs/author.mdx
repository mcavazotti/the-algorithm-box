**Hi, my name is Matheus Cavazotti** (you can pronounce my first name like _mah - te - us_)

I am a husband, a father and also a software developer. I was born and have grown up in southern Brazil, where I graduated in Computer Science, met my wife, had a child and received my Master's degree. I like to learn, play music, draw, go outdoors and, of course, programming.

Since I started programming in college, I've wanted to have a blog or a website where I could share what I know and somehow help people on their paths, jut like many others have helped me when I found their pages by change. Well, The Algorithm Box is my second attempt of doing that, but I think this time it'll work out!
