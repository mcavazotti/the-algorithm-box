The Algorithm Box was build as a side project to help to help [me](/the-algorithm-box/author) deepen my knowledge about algorithms, data structures and C++, while also sharing it with others. I'm taking inspiration from the concept of [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) to write my texts (articles, tutorials... I'm not sure yet how to call them), so you'll find a mix of explanations and code.

Speaking of code, this website is just half of what The Algorithm Box is. The other half is the actual code that is presented in these pages, which is available in a Github repository linked in the topbar. Like I said, my plan is to learn and be able to teach others, and I've noticed that we've grown so used to work with libraries and frameworks that most of the times we don't know anymore how things work under the hood. Therefore, what I want to explore with this project ranges from simple data structures (such as linked lists) to more complex algorithms, while avoiding using external libraries as much as possible. This even includes the standard library. Also, expect a lot of Computer Graphics related content, since it's a topic of interst of mine.

I'm not an expert, so there's a chance that my code has bugs or that my explanations are a bit off. If that's the case, or you just have a question or a suggestion, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/mcavazotti/the-algorithm-box/issues/new/choose) on Github.

Without further ado, go to the navigation menu, find something that interests you and happy learning!
